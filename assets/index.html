    Stylesheets and Preprocessors
    ==============================
    You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
    using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
    of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).
    By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
    here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less)
    are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
    a single file.
    To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:
    + Change the order of your CSS files
    + Import stylesheets from other directories
    + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

    Client-side Templates
    ========================
    HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
    To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
    that you load these templates client-side.
    By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
    client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
    include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).
    To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:
    + Import templates from other directories
    + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
    + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
    stringfile before they're served.

    <!--
    Client-side Javascript
    ========================
    You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
    on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
    take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).
    By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
    automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
    CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
    and concatenated into a single file.
    To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
    For example, here are a few things you could do:
    + Change the order of your scripts
    + Import scripts from other directories
    + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
